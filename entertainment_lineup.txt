Chelsea High school Celtic Choir Michigan
    BIO:    Celtic with a Kick!
            Chelsea House Orchestra (CHO) provides a varied and colorful performance repertoire with the majority of the music derived from traditional Celtic sources. However, other folk music sources are used to provide students with an eclectic musical experience.
            The basic philosophy of the arrangements is to allow everyone in the group to enjoy Celtic music as much as possible. Consequently, the majority of the playing is melody based with very little inner harmony or separate part writing. This truly provides students a contrasting experience from their normal school orchestra.
            All music is memorized and arrangements often evolve from rehearsals and suggestions from students. Individuals are showcased through the use of solos, duos, and special features.

Andrew McManus Trio Cleveland.
