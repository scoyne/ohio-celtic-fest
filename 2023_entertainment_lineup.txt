Chelsea High school Celtic Choir Michigan
    BIO:    Celtic with a Kick!
            Chelsea House Orchestra (CHO) provides a varied and colorful performance repertoire with the majority of the music derived from traditional Celtic sources. However, other folk music sources are used to provide students with an eclectic musical experience.
            The basic philosophy of the arrangements is to allow everyone in the group to enjoy Celtic music as much as possible. Consequently, the majority of the playing is melody based with very little inner harmony or separate part writing. This truly provides students a contrasting experience from their normal school orchestra.
            All music is memorized and arrangements often evolve from rehearsals and suggestions from students. Individuals are showcased through the use of solos, duos, and special features.

Next Generation Leahy
    BIO:    As with all forces of nature, the music and energy created by The Next Generation Leahy simply cannot be contained. The drive to create music is powerful within each of the Leahy children. It has given rise to multi-instrumental talents, whose dynamic live performances have been described as “astounding” and “breath-taking.” For the last several years, Next Generation Leahy has performed across North America, and shared the stage with the likes of The Chieftains, We Banjo 3, The Tenors, and Natalie MacMaster & Donnell Leahy. With one CD under their belt, they are working on new material for a new CD to be released in 2019. Belying their young ages, these siblings are all accomplished multi-instrumentalists whose live performances are filled with the high-energy, infectious music associated with the Leahy name. However, not content to play only the music of their Celtic heritage, these musicians explore many genres of music and pull influences from far and wide. Fiddle, cello, French accordion, singing, piano, and French-Canadian step-dancing serve to bring their unique style of music to life. The music that lives in each of these young people - which is so joyful, so positive, and so rare – overflows from them and affects audiences who have witnessed something truly unique and remarkable.

Andrew McManus Trio Cleveland. 
    BIO:    Andrew Mcmanus is a singer-songwriter from Armagh, Northern Ireland. Growing up at the tail-end of the Troubles near the ancient Celtic site of Emain Macha, Andrew was heavily influenced by the local myths and legends of Irish literature that were set there; the tales of Cú Chulainn, Queen Macha, and the epic saga of the Táin Bó Cúailnge. These stories deeply inspired his creativity and a love for Irish folk tunes which led him to producing artwork and music with a distinctly Celtic and ethereal quality.

Mossy Moran.  Cleveland. 
    BIO:        "You just can't believe that he is just one voice and a guitar!" is often heard by audiences on hearing Mossy perform for their first time. His deep baritone voice coupled with a thundering velvet hand on his guitars cause people to stop and listen. His Irish wit and stage presence are infectious. Derek Warfield of the Wolfe Tones commented that Mossy is one of the finest Irish solo acts he's seen in years.
